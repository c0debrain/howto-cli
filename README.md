# Your personal command line assistant

Despite years of experience I have problem to remember all the Unix black magic. I use `git` on daily basis and still strugle with more advanced commands. Introducing `docker` made my experience with terminal even worse.

`howto-cli` comes to the rescue. Ask a question directly in your terminal and get an answer immediately.

# Installation and usage
`npm i -g howto-cli`

You should now have access to the command `howto`. For the start try a few simple questions:
- `howto create a file`
- `howto clone git repo`
- `howto list active processes`

# Current status
This project is currently on the proof-of-concept phase. Supported 

# Analytics
To get as much feedback as possible every question you ask is anonymously sent to my server. This is needed to analyse what questions the knowledge base fails to answer.

Without anonymous usage analytics I am unable to improve the product. If you are concerned about privacy let me know in [this issue](https://github.com/ziolko/howto-cli/issues/1).
